**ChatGPT**: Python script and Python implementation can start where the path where we're crossing overwall has an additional cost.

**ChatGPT**: The population algorithm, when crossing open air, is 1, and when it crosses close to an obstacle, it increases the number of obstacles. The train, in this case, will only be divided into open air or wall, and crossing a wall is only allowed if the crossing happens perpendicularly.

**ChatGPT**: you can reduce the cost of crossing a wall to three. And also, can you please make an example, make a test case of the scenario just described in order to test the algorithm by making a matplotlib script.

**ChatGPT**: Right now, the walls are considered part of the terrain. Can you instead assume that the walls are given as a list of line segments?

**ChatGPT**: I'd like the path stored also as a list of line segments. Think of a polyline.

**ChatGPT**: We want to incur an additional cost for changing directions during the pathfinding. So, turning 90 degrees should incur an additional cost of 90 degrees.

**ChatGPT**: The "is_valid_turn" method throws an error. Calculate the actual angle of the direction change in degrees, and compare that to the allowed angles.

**ChatGPT**: In this example, we have a grid of open air. Instead of representing that as a grid, can you change the algorithm so that the "terrain crossing penalty" is calculated based on distance travelled instead? That way, the grid can become superfluous

**ChatGPT**: Now make a function that generates a building outline of an arbitrary rectangular, L-shaped, T-shaped or H-shaped building. Add a variable to determine number of internal rooms, then divide the building shape into small and large rooms and bound these rooms by walls in the format the current code accepts.

**ChatGPT**: When defining shapes, define points first, then use this to define a closed polyline, then divide into walls. Just recreate the shape definitions, I don't need the rest of the code for now.

**ChatGPT**: Make a base class called "Shape" that contains a list of all points and a method that defines and stores the surrounding polyline as an instance variable from those points. Use a concave-hull algorithm to make the polyline. Derive sub-classes for each shape that generates the actual points for the list.
